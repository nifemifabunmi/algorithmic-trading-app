üìä Strategy Details
Moving Average Crossover Strategy
Signal Logic:

Buy Signal: Short-term MA crosses above long-term MA
Sell Signal: Short-term MA crosses below long-term MA
Risk Filters: RSI-based overbought/oversold conditions

Risk Management:

Position sizing controls
Transaction cost modeling (default: 0.1% per trade)
Maximum drawdown monitoring
Volatility-based risk assessment

üìà Performance Metrics
Return Metrics

Total Return: Cumulative strategy performance
Annualized Return: Time-adjusted return calculation
Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return measure
Sortino Ratio: Downside risk-adjusted performance
Alpha & Beta: Market-relative performance measures

Risk Metrics

Maximum Drawdown: Peak-to-trough portfolio decline
Value at Risk (VaR): 95% confidence interval loss estimate
Volatility: Annualized return standard deviation
Win Rate: Percentage of profitable trades
